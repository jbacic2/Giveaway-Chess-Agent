Chess is a board game played across the world dating back to the 6th century AD<sup>[1](https://www.britannica.com/topic/chess)</sup>. Over the centuries there have been a wide array of variations of this game. One of these variations which first appeared in the mid-late 1800s is called giveaway chess<sup>[2](http://www.chessvariants.org/diffobjective.dir/giveaway.html)</sup>. 

##Rules of the Game
The rules for giveaway chess follow the rules of traditional chess with the following modifications:
- If a player can kill a piece on their turn they must capture a piece
- There is no castling (a special move between the king and rook in traditional chess)
- The king is a “normal” piece that can be killed just like any other piece. As a result, there is no sense of check or checkmate in this game. 
- If a pawn gets to the end of this board it can be promoted to a king. 
- A player wins the game when they have lost all their pieces or they have no pieces which they can legally move.
- A stalemate (a tie) occurs if both players still have movable pieces left but it is not possible for these pieces to kill each other.
